# Web Search Engines - UNED Master's Repository

This repository contains materials, exercises, and research papers for the Web Search Engines subject, part of the master's program at UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia).

## Repository Contents

### Research Papers

The repository includes several key research papers on web search technologies and user behavior:

1. **Legacy Searching the Web Paper** (01_legacy_searching_the_web_paper.pdf)
   - A foundational paper covering the early history and evolution of web search technologies
   - Discusses early search architectures and algorithms that shaped modern search engines

2. **Top 5 Papers in Web Search** (02_top5_papers_web_search.pdf)
   - Collection of five influential papers in the field of web search technology
   - Covers fundamental algorithms, data structures, and techniques used by search engines

3. **User Behavior in Web Search** (03_user_behavior_in_web_search.pdf)
   - Analysis of how users interact with search engines
   - Covers topics such as query formulation, result examination, and click behavior
   - Insights into user intent and satisfaction metrics

4. **Increasing Index Size in Search Engines** (04_increasing_index_size_in_search_engine.pdf)
   - Technical paper on scaling search engine indexes
   - Explores efficient data structures and algorithms for managing large-scale web indexes
   - Performance optimization techniques for search query handling

### Exercises

The `exercises` directory contains practical assignments and hands-on tasks to apply the theoretical concepts covered in the papers. These exercises help develop skills in:

- Search algorithm implementation
- Index construction and optimization
- Query processing and ranking
- Search evaluation and metrics

## Course Objectives

This subject aims to provide a deep understanding of:

1. How modern web search engines operate
2. Algorithms for efficient information retrieval
