# Web Search Engines - UNED Master's Repository

This repository contains my exercises and work for the Web Search Engines subject, part of the master's program at UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia).

## Exercises

The following exercises explore different aspects of web search engine technology:

1. [Legacy Searching the Web](01_legacy_searching_the_web_paper.pdf)
   - Analysis of foundational web search technologies
   - Historical evolution of search architectures and algorithms
   - Study of early search engines and their impact on modern systems

2. [Top 5 Papers in Web Search](02_top5_papers_web_search.pdf)
   - Review of five influential research papers in web search technology
   - Analysis of key algorithms and data structures used in search engines
   - Assessment of their impact on the field of information retrieval

3. [User Behavior in Web Search](03_user_behavior_in_web_search.pdf)
   - Study of how users interact with search engines
   - Analysis of query formulation and result examination patterns
   - Insights into user intent recognition and satisfaction metrics

4. [Increasing Index Size in Search Engines](04_increasing_index_size_in_search_engine.pdf)
   - Exploration of techniques for scaling search engine indexes
   - Study of efficient data structures for large-scale web indexing
